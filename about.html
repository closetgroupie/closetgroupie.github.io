			<h2>About sewingly</h2>
				<p>Sewingly is a peer to peer marketplace for fabric and needle artists.  We invite sewists, knitters, quilters, weavers, crocheters, smockers, and any other type of needle artist to sell their work through sewingly.com.  We also welcome specialty craft supply shops to sell their supplies on sewingly. </p>

				<p>I believe that there are many of us who love and appreciate homespun quilts, clothes, and home decor.  I also believe that our genre deserves its own marketplace.  Please join me in creating sewingly.   If you would like to know more about me, you can click the link to my blog below.   -Kelly</p>
